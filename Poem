This is a poem about the Earth:

The earth is a big round ball.
It is made of dirt and water, and its not very small.
It has mountains and trees.
It's the bees knees.
The Earth is pretty great,
but lets give a quick shoutout to Christina Applegate.

Other planets are pretty cool, I guess.
But Earth's still the best.
On the Earth people play chess,
and birds make their nests.
Earth day is a day
It's where kids go out and play
We love the earth and all its wealth
The earth allows us to improve our health
